# Feature Design Document: [Feature Name]

## Feature Overview
**What is this feature?**  
Brief description of the feature, the problem it solves, and the value it provides.

**Who is it for?**  
Identify the primary user(s) or stakeholder(s).

---

## Goals & Success Criteria

- List clear goals for the feature (e.g. improve engagement, enable a new workflow)
- Define measurable success criteria (e.g. 80% task completion, response under 200ms)

---

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- What should the feature do?
- What user inputs or actions are involved?
- What are the expected outputs or side effects?

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance expectations
- Accessibility needs
- Security or privacy considerations

---

## Feature Design

### UI/UX
- Sketches, mockups, or component descriptions
- Navigation flows or entry points
- Responsive behavior (mobile, desktop, etc.)

### Backend / Data
- New APIs or services needed
- Data models or database changes
- Integration points (e.g. third-party services)

---

## Implementation Plan

1. **Setup & Scaffolding**  
   Set up routes, feature flags, folders, and any placeholder logic or data structures.

2. **Core Logic & Data Flow**  
   Implement backend endpoints, data models, and business logic. Ensure correct data flow and validation.

3. **UI Development**  
   Build the user interface and connect it with the core logic. Add accessibility and responsiveness.

4. **Integration & Edge Cases**  
   Handle error states, edge cases, loading states, and fallback logic.

5. **Polish & Production Readiness**  
   Add telemetry, finalize styling, conduct code review, and prepare for release (docs, toggles, etc.)

## Testing & Validation

### Unit Tests
- Components
- API handlers
- Data validation logic

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end user flows
- Error handling and retries
- State management across navigation

### Manual Testing
- Cross-browser and mobile testing
- Accessibility (keyboard, screen reader)
- Exploratory testing around edge cases

### Acceptance Criteria
- Feature behaves as expected across all supported platforms
- All success criteria are met
- No critical regression or performance degradation
